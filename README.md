# Welcome, you came for the right ass!
Why use such a funky name, you might ask? Well, it stands for something that we want most websites to use and embrace. An accessible and search engine optimized design system. Abbreviated, ass. 

Take a look at our approaches to organzing css code and giving a website the right semantic structure. Or check out how you could use the CSS definitions we created for html templates, snippets or just that one element you've been stuck on perfectioning for a while.

Thanks for stopping by, and have fun with this repository :wave:
